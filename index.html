            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            As cities grow, data-driven decision-making is essential for better land use, last-mile connectivity, and meeting community needs.
            In this project, I utilized Bristol Open Data to develop an interactive <strong>geospatial dashboard for Bristol city</strong>
            aimed at supporting policymakers, urban planners, and residents in making informed decisions.
            The dashboard provides postcode-level insights into building access to essential amenities‚Äîgreen spaces, schools, healthcare facilities, and bus stops‚Äîenabling users to assess how well different parts of the city are connected and identify areas that require infrastructure improvements.

            <p><strong>Urban tree coverage - Kingston upon Thames </strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Urban greenery plays a vital role in enhancing air quality, reducing urban heat, and supporting physical and
                mental well-being. This project assessed <strong>ward-wise urban tree coverage in London</strong>, with a focused case
                study on Kingston upon Thames. Using the Overpass API, 27,521 building geometries were extracted from 
                OpenStreetMap. Each building was evaluated for access to healthy green space by calculating proximity 
                to trees in good condition. Buildings within 100 meters of such trees were classified as having green access. 
                The analysis revealed that 13,906 households in Kingston lack a healthy tree within 100 meters.

            <p><strong>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Urban Growth </strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
             Urban growth is a global phenomenon that significantly impacts the environmental and socio-economic 
                dimensions of cities. To accommodate population demands, natural landscapes are drastically transformed 
                into built environments.
             Historical Land use analysis is an efficient method to understand the urban growth phases and how cities evolved. 
             This project focuses on the <strong>urban growth of Staten Island from 1984 to 2024</strong>, 
                analysing Landsat 8 data for land use changes.
             Using a deep learning model, identified a 24% loss in green spaces over the past 40 years and estimated 
                by 2050 the study area will have only 3% greenspaces.

                Trees are crucial in reducing land surface temperature, managing floods,

                "Trees deserve more than being a point on our map‚Äù and they must be incorporated into environmental planning to maximize their benefits.  
                Using the Segment Anything Model and QGIS, <strong> I mapped 18797 üå≥ trees in Sheffield </strong>.  The tree dataset is crucial for monitoring tree health, 
                estimating tree cover, deriving trees per capita and indices, 
                and contributing to urban greening projects, forestry management, and environmental conservation.  </p>

              Identifying priority places for physical activity is crucial for shaping healthier urban environments. 
              It enables data-driven planning to enhance public health,
              lower carbon emissions through active travel, and foster inclusive, socially connected communities. 
              This project focuses on a detailed analysis and the development of three distinct <strong> Physical 
              Activity Indices for London boroughs - Indoor Physical activity, .</strong> Key factors influencing physical activity like <strong> access to facilities, 
              public transport connectivity, safety, demographic factors, and 
              walking behaviour</strong> integrated to construct the indices. 
              The results highlight and identify the boroughs that require targeted interventions to encourage healthier,

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Food advertising is a pervasive force shaping consumer behaviour, encompassing placement strategies, 
                social influences, and adolescent responses. This project analysed food environments using advertisement 
                data to understand the spatial distribution of food ads and how targeted marketing near educational spaces 
                can influence dietary behaviours and health outcomes.  
                The analysis uncovered critical links between advertising practices and societal factors, offering valuable 
                insights for designing informed public health interventions and urban policies aimed at promoting healthier

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This study involves an environmental and social vulnerability analysis of North Lakhimpur, covering an area of 14 sq. km. By integrating demographic data with NDVI, land use/land cover (LULC), groundwater and surface water levels, rainfall patterns, historical flood records, water quality, and transport network data, we developed key indices at the ward level to identify critical environmental and infrastructure challenges.
                Using image processing and spatial analysis techniques, the study assessed land cover changes from 2000 to 2018, 
                and derived indices such as the Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI), Agricultural Vulnerability Index (AVI), 
                and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). My role in the project involved contributing to innovative strategies for natural

            <p><strong>Spatial Analysis of Crime patterns to identify and predict future crime hotspots</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
            One of the significant challenges pressuring urban environments is the rising crime rate, and increasing crimes highly impact 
                the socio-economic systems of the cities. The City of London has an overall crime rate of 819 crimes per 1000 people in the year 2022, which is 762% higher
                compared to the overall London crime rate. This project focuses on crime patterns by identifying high-crime locations, analysis revealed <strong>101 crime hotspots</strong> with over 50 reported crimes in proximity and 
                <strong>23 hotspots with more than 150 crimes.</strong> Building on this, incorporating 2021-2024 crime data <strong>predicted 324 potential future crime hotspots.</strong> These insights can support targeted policing strategies and urban planning for safer communities.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The concept of 20-minute neighbourhoods emphasizes the importance of building cities that prioritize walkability, accessibility, and inclusivity. To understand neighbourhoods at granular level in Bradford, an <strong>Accessibility score and Accessibility Index</strong> are 
                derived for each 20-minute (800m walkable grid) neighbourhood and evaluated access to services (Health, Green Spaces, Local public transport, Grocery stores, restaurants, Banks, Education) and Desired services (recreational spaces, post office).
                This analysis provides actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and developers, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to create equitable and 
                sustainable neighbourhoods.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Multicriteria spatial analysis is essential for identifying optimal residential sites that support sustainable 
                urban development. This project focused on Bristol and aimed to identify residential buildings near schools, 
                parks, and green spaces that also have high solar panel potential. These criteria promote access to education,
                encourage active lifestyles, and support renewable energy goals. Buffer analysis (300‚Äì500m) was used to 
                determine accessibility to amenities, while overlay analysis combined these zones with solar suitability data.
                Residential buildings were categorized into three levels of suitability‚Äîmost, moderate, and not suitable‚Äîbased 
                on spatial intersection. This approach helps urban planners prioritize areas for green infrastructure and policy

                Image processing techniques were used to identify shift from predominantly agricultural land to residential development.
                Physical infrastructure assessments revealed issues such as open drains, waste dumping, and illegal construction. 
                Development proposals to improve drainage systems, promoting rooftop farming and solar energy use, 
                enhancing waste management, and empowering local communities through cottage industries were proposed.
