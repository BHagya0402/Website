  <!-- ðŸ§­ SECTION 1: ABOUT ME -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m Bhagya Sri Chintakula, a <strong> Urban Data Analyst and Planner </strong> passionate about turning data into meaningful insights 
      that drive sustainable development. With a background in urban planning and data science, I specialize in spatial analysis, 
      environmental impact assessments, smart city solutions, and infrastructure development. <br>
      I am always on the search for new opportunities to study and gain more information. 
      My academic journey began with a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering</strong>, which sparked my interest in the 
      built environment and infrastructure systems. I deepened this foundation by pursuing a <strong>Masterâ€™s in Urban and Rural 
      Planning at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee </strong>, where I developed a strong understanding of spatial planning 
      and sustainable development. To further refine my technical and analytical skills, I completed an <strong> MSc in Urban Data Science 
      and Analytics at the University of Leeds </strong>, where I merged planning knowledge with data-driven urban analysis. <br>
      My master's thesis, 'Planning for Sustainable Mobility in the Visakhapatnam GVMC area,' aimed to assess the Urban transport system
      in Visakhapatnam city by creating Spatial maps for the sustainable mobility indicators (using GIS and Erdas Imagine). 
      Visualizing and analyzing the sustainable Environment, Social, and Economic impact profiles for the study area guided me 
      to develop potential recommendations for improving mobility in GVMC.<br>
      Working on Integrated development plan, Neighbourhood Plan, Environmental 
      Management Plan, Urban mobility planning and strategic master plans I got 
      exposed to the survey, fieldwork, urban and rural development challenges, 
      and the importance of data-driven solutions. I realized the crucial  role 
      data can play in shaping resilient, inclusive cities. <br>
Over the past four years, Iâ€™ve worked across environmental assessment projects, spatial analysis for urban development, 
      crime analysis and web applications that bridge the gap between planners and 
      the public. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the systems-thinking approach to 
      urban challenges and the use of machine learning for geospatial applications. 
      I aim to advance research in healthy, active, and sustainable urban environments.
      <br>Outside of work, I enjoy reading, traveling, cooking and discovering new cuisines.
  <br> Whether you're a fellow researcher, planner, or simply curious about how data can shape smarter, healthier citiesâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect.
